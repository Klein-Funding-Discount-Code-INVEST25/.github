## 🚀 What is Klein Funding?

Klein Funding is a UK-based crypto-exclusive proprietary trading firm launched in late 2024 and registered as Klein Tech Ltd — a next-generation prop firm built entirely around one asset class, one exchange partnership, and one mission: giving serious cryptocurrency traders access to funded capital on real Bybit infrastructure with zero spreads, zero commissions, and up to 100% of the simulated profits they generate. In less than two years of operation, Klein Funding has grown to over 11,000 active traders across 130+ countries, processed payouts consistently within 12 to 24 hours, and earned recognition as Best Crypto Prop Firm at the FundedTrading Awards 2025 — a distinction driven by its customisable account structure, genuine Bybit partnership, and a support team that traders consistently describe as responding within seconds on Discord.

What separates Klein Funding from every other prop firm in the industry is the combination of exchange authenticity and account customisability. When a trader opens a position on a Klein Funding account, it executes inside Bybit's professional trading environment — zero spreads, no slippage on stable pairs, and access to over 700 USDT perpetual futures pairs across major, mid-cap, and altcoin markets at leverage of up to 1:100. The account structure is genuinely customisable: traders choose their evaluation format — 1-Step, 2-Step, 3-Step, or Instant Pro — their drawdown level from 6% to 14%, and their profit split target from 40% all the way to 100%, building an account that fits their specific strategy and risk tolerance rather than accepting a one-size-fits-all structure. Standard account challenges start from just $41 for a $6,000 evaluation, with funded account sizes scaling from $6,000 up to $300,000 and an Instant Pro pathway that skips the evaluation entirely and offers scaling to $2,000,000 in managed capital for experienced traders ready to fund immediately.

## 💼 Why Choose Klein Funding Over Other Prop Firms?

Klein Funding has built a reputation as one of the most execution-authentic, payout-fast, and trader-customisable crypto prop firms operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **Real Bybit execution — zero spreads, zero commissions** — every position on a Klein Funding Standard account executes inside Bybit's professional trading environment, giving traders genuine exchange-quality fills with no artificial spread overlay, no commission charges on trades, and no synthetic pricing engine between the order and the market; traders interact with real Bybit liquidity across 700+ USDT perpetual pairs in exactly the same execution environment used by professional Bybit traders globally
- **Fully customisable account structure — drawdown and profit split on your terms** — unlike firms that impose a fixed drawdown and profit split with no flexibility, Klein Funding lets every trader configure their own challenge: choose a drawdown level from 6% all the way up to 14%, and set the profit split target from 40% up to 100%, building an evaluation account that matches the natural volatility tolerance of the strategy being traded rather than forcing every trader through an identical risk framework regardless of their approach
- **Up to 100% profit split — keep every dollar you earn** — the maximum profit split configuration at Klein Funding delivers 100% of all simulated profits to the trader with nothing withheld by the firm, a figure that no traditional futures or forex prop firm comes close to matching and that reflects Klein Funding's core philosophy of rewarding trading performance rather than treating the evaluation as the primary revenue stream
- **Four evaluation formats for every trader type** — the 1-Step evaluation is the fastest path to funding with a single 6% profit target and a static balance-based drawdown; the 2-Step spreads the challenge across two phases with a 45% stability score requirement for consistency; the 3-Step provides the most room across three phases for traders who prefer a gradual evaluation with maximum drawdown flexibility; and Instant Pro skips evaluation entirely for experienced traders who want immediate funded access with a 70% profit split and a scaling pathway to $2,000,000 in managed capital
- **12 to 24-hour payout processing — often just 4 hours** — Klein Funding's documented payout turnaround is 12 to 24 hours from approval, with traders consistently reporting same-session payouts processed in as little as 4 hours via USDT, USDC, or bank transfer — one of the fastest payout pipelines of any crypto prop firm, confirmed across hundreds of Trustpilot reviews referencing specific withdrawal amounts and timestamps
- **Bank transfer payout option alongside crypto** — in addition to USDT and USDC crypto withdrawals, Klein Funding offers bank transfer payouts — an uncommon option among crypto prop firms that typically operate crypto-only, giving traders in regions with strong banking infrastructure a fiat withdrawal route without converting through a third-party exchange
- **On-demand payouts from the funded phase** — funded traders can request withdrawals at any time once the minimum eligibility threshold is met, with no restriction to specific calendar payout windows, no bi-weekly waiting periods, and no minimum profit threshold beyond what is documented in the account terms
- **1:100 leverage across all Standard account types** — Klein Funding supports leverage of up to 1:100 on Bybit perpetual pairs, giving experienced crypto traders meaningful position sizing power relative to their funded account balance and significantly more intraday leverage than the 1:2 or 1:5 leverage caps seen at most competing crypto prop firms
- **No country restrictions — available in 130+ countries** — Klein Funding explicitly operates without the country-based access restrictions that affect many Bybit-linked prop firms, accepting traders from all 130+ supported countries regardless of Bybit's own regional limitations, a deliberate design decision that expands access to professional crypto funding beyond the regions most firms serve
- **Swap-free trading on all accounts** — there are no overnight swap charges on any Klein Funding account, meaning traders who hold positions across sessions or overnight incur no additional daily cost beyond the standard execution fill, a meaningful advantage for swing-oriented crypto traders running multi-day strategies
- **Static balance-based drawdown — never trailing from equity highs** — the drawdown on Klein Funding Standard accounts is calculated from account balance rather than from intraday equity peaks, meaning a position that dips unrealised intraday but does not close as a loss does not move the drawdown floor; only closed losses affect the balance-based drawdown calculation, giving traders genuine room to manage open positions through normal intraday volatility without a trailing floor tightening in real time
- **News trading permitted across all account types** — high-impact economic events and major crypto-specific announcements are freely tradeable on Klein Funding accounts with no mandatory flat-position windows, no pre-event buffer restrictions, and no post-event hold periods that limit strategy execution around macro catalysts
- **Instant Pro scaling to $2,000,000 in managed capital** — the Instant Pro pathway allows traders to skip evaluation and begin with immediate funded access, with the account scaling up to $2,000,000 in managed capital after reaching a 10% profit milestone — a scaling trigger that requires forfeiting 50% of current profits in exchange for a doubled account size, offering a clear if unconventional growth trajectory for traders who prioritise capital access over short-term profit retention
- **24/7 support with sub-minute Discord response times** — Klein Funding's support team operates around the clock on Discord, with traders consistently reporting response times measured in seconds rather than hours, including direct involvement from senior team members and in documented cases the CEO himself for account-level issues requiring escalation beyond standard support
- **Best Crypto Prop Firm 2025 — FundedTrading Award** — Klein Funding was recognised as Best Crypto Prop Firm by FundedTrading in 2025, an independent evaluation based on account customisability, Bybit partnership quality, payout speed, and overall trader conditions — the first major industry award the firm has received since its launch in late 2024 and a validation of its rapid growth into one of the leading crypto-native funded trading environments globally

## 🔓 Reduce Your Startup Cost with INVEST25

Klein Funding Standard account evaluations start from just $41 for a $6,000 1-Step challenge — already among the lowest entry-point evaluation fees of any crypto prop firm relative to the account size and execution quality on offer, with zero commissions, zero spreads, and 1:100 leverage included at every tier. With the discount code **INVEST25**, you reduce that already competitive Standard account cost by a further 25%, making it the most affordable legitimate entry to a real Bybit execution environment, a fully customisable drawdown and profit split structure, and on-demand payouts processed in as little as 4 hours via USDT, USDC, or bank transfer available anywhere in the crypto prop trading market today.

At 25% off Standard accounts, the financial barrier to accessing genuine exchange-quality crypto funded trading drops to a level where the evaluation fee itself becomes almost incidental — leaving traders free to configure their account to their strategy, approach the static balance-based drawdown with the disciplined risk management Klein Funding's structure is designed to reward, and build toward a funded account where every dollar of simulated profit flows directly to their payout with no commissions, no spreads, and no unnecessary deductions between performance and payment.
